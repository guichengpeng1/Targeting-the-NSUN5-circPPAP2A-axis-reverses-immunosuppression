Targeting-the-NSUN5-circPPAP2A-axis-reverses-immunosuppression and sensitizes renal cell carcinoma to anti-PD-1 therapy


Abstract
Background: The role of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) RNA modification in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is recognized, yet its function and regulation on circular RNAs (circRNAs) remain uncharted. This study aims to identify key m5C regulators in ccRCC, with a focus on this under-explored circRNA dimension, and to determine their clinical significance.
Methods: m5C-MeRIP-seq was performed on clinical samples. The expression and prognostic value of m5C regulators were analyzed using TCGA, ICGC, and SYSU cohort. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics were employed to decipher the tumor immune microenvironment. Functional experiments were conducted in vitro and in vivo. Mechanisms were investigated via RIP, RNA pull-down, and ChIP-qPCR. A nanoparticle-based siRNA delivery system was used for therapeutic assessment.
Results: NSUN5 was identified as the predominant m5C methyltransferase, with high expression predicting poor survival in ccRCC. Mechanistically, NSUN5 installed an m5C modification on circPPAP2A, which was recognized and stabilized by YBX1. The NSUN5/circPPAP2A/YBX1 axis enhanced YBX1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation, leading to transcriptional activation of HIF-2α. Clinically, NSUN5 expression correlated with HIF-2α inhibitor sensitivity. scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics revealed that this axis suppresses CD8⁺ T cell infiltration by downregulating CCL5 and promotes T cell exhaustion by upregulating TGFB1, thereby fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Knockdown of NSUN5 or circPPAP2A in vivo synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy, potently inhibiting tumor growth and restoring anti-tumor immunity.
Conclusions: Unlike prior studies focused on mRNA, we establish the NSUN5/circPPAP2A/YBX1 axis as the first identified epigenetic circuit that coordinately activates HIF-2α signaling and induces immunosuppression in ccRCC. This dual function explains its role in conferring co-resistance to both HIF-2α-targeted therapies and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Therefore, targeting this axis provides a novel combinatorial strategy to overcome this dual clinical resistance.
